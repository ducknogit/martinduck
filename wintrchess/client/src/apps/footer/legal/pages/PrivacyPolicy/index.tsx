            <span>
                3.1 We use cookies to store a session token string. This keeps you from
                needing to solve a CAPTCHA to access Chess game analysis and move
                classifications, but doesn't contain any personally identifying information.
                It is highly recommended to keep cookies on; you may otherwise lose
                functionality. The CAPTCHA is proof-of-work based; it in itself does not
                collect any personal data.
            </span>

            <span>
                3.2 When you analyse a game on the Website, we collect any information that you
                have explicitly provided to us. This includes the PGN (Portable Game Notation)
                file that represents the game that you have chosen to analyse. Depending on the
                PGN file provided, this may include:

                <ul>
                    <li>Player names and ratings</li>
                    <li>Tournament and event information</li>
                    <li>Time control, variant, results and other game metadata</li>
                </ul>

                3.3 We collect PGN files in order to process your analysis request.
                We may sometimes retain PGN files provided for game analysis for longer periods
                of time in order to improve the Website and aid the development of new services.
                If PGN files are retained for this reason, they will be anonymised.
            </span>

            <span>
                3.4 When you search for games on your Chess.com or Lichess account, the username
                that you provided will be collected by those respective services. Chess.com
                and Lichess are based in the United States and France respectively, so by
                searching for games on your account, you agree to having your data processed
                in these countries.

                    <li>
                        The last game source you selected with the game selector.

                    <li>
                        The last inputs you gave for each game source in the game selector.
                        For example, this may be your username in the "Select game from Chess.com"
                        field, or the last PGN you provided to the "Select game from PGN" field.
