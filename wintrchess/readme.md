## 📂 Project

The WintrChess repository is a monorepo made up of three packages:

#### `client`
The frontend for the website built with React and TypeScript.

#### `server`
The backend for the website where the website content is served, and where any API endpoints will live.

#### `shared`
Libraries, some types and common logic is stored here and can be accessed by both other packages.
